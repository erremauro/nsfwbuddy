# How to contribute

We're excited you decided to contribute to this project! Contributions can be simple as fixing a typo in the documentation or more complex like fixing a bug or develop a new feature.

## How to make a simple correction

Documentation are stored in the repository as Markdown files. Simple changes to the content of a Markdown file can be made in the browser by selecting the Edit link in the upper right corner of the browser window. (In narrow browser windows you'll need to expand the options bar to see the Edit link.) Follow the directions to create a pull request (PR). We will review the PR and accept it or suggest changes.

## How to make a more complex submission

You'll need a basic understanding of [Git and GitHub].

* Open an [issue] describing what do you want to do, such as fixing a bug or propose a new feature, then wait for an approval before you begin to work on your changes.
* Fork [nsfwbuddy] repository and make your changes in your forked repository.
* Submit a pull request (PR) to the master branch with your changes.
* Respond to PR feedback.
